@incollection{Beatty2000,
abstract = {(from the chapter) The heart of this chapter consists of a systematic review of the empirical literature utilizing task-evoked pupillary responses in the study of human cognitive processes. A common graphic format is used in presenting these results so that diverse experimental findings may be directly compared. The result is a consistent depiction of intensity variations in human cognitive processing as reflected by task-evoked pupillary responses. The authors conclude with a few small suggestions for future pupillometric studies and the role that they may play in cognitive neuroscience more generally. (chapter) Topics include: historical background (large-scale pupillary movements in clinical neurology, small-scale pupillary movements in cognitive psychophysiology, psychophysiological reporter variables); physical context (pupillary anatomy, pupillary movements, pupillary reflex dilations, pupillary pharmacology); and inferential context: task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs) are reporter variables (biometrics: measuring pupillary movements, psychometrics: computing TEPRs, TEPRs as a general measure of processing load, TEPRs and perception, TEPRs and memory, TEPRs and responding, TEPRs and probability, TEPRs and language, TEPRs and attention, TEPRs and individual differences).
